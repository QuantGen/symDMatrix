Title: Memory-Mapped Distributed Symmetric Matrix
Description: A symmetric matrix is partitioned into blocks as follows: G11 G12
    G33 \ G21 G22 G33 \ G31 G32 G33. Because the matrix is assumed to be symmetric
    (i.e., Gij=Gji), only the upper-triangular blocks are stored. Each block is
    stored as a flat file using an ff object. The package defines the class and
    multiple methods that allow treating this memory-mapped matrix as a standard RAM
    matrix.
